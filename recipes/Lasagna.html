    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>

        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess grease from the pan.</li>

        <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet, and sauté for a few minutes until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
        
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with half of the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping each other.</li>
        
        <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        
        <li>Repeat the layers, starting with the noodles and ending with a layer of meat sauce. Make sure to reserve some shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan for the top.</li>
        
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the top. Return the lasagna to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        
        <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
        
        <li>Slice and serve the lasagna, and enjoy the delicious layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheesy goodness!</li>
